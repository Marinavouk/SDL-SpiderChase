# SDL-SpiderChase
 SDL Game
-----------------------------------
A personal game made for learning- and understanding more of C++, and how to create games using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

------------------------------------

I learned- and gained a lot of experience from this project. I learned a lot about how to organize my code in a good and logic way, to make it easy to read, understand and maintain. I also learned how to create- and use object-pooling, which is used for reusing game objects in this game. Furthermore, I also learn about animations, colliders, timers and UI.
It was a great challenge for me and it helped me get closer to my goal, which is to learn something new every day and keep getting better at what I do.
