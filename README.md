------------------------------------
Learned and gained a lot of experience from this project. Understood how to use object pooling for the fireballs and for the spiders. Learned how to organize my files and the code so easier to read and interact with it. Animations, colliders, time, UI it was a great challenge for me to get een closer to my goal. Learning each day something new and getting better for what I do.
